            "Fundamentals Exactly what probabilities are has been the subject of contentious debate. Some people think that probabilities are long-run frequencies that only apply to events that can happen over and over again under identical conditions. Others think that probabilities quantify an individual's subjective degree of uncertainty about events of any kind and can vary across individuals. Still others don't fall rigidly into either of those groups. Arguments about the meaning of probability led the great probabilist Jimmie Savage (1917-1971) to observe caustically that \"[A]s to what probability is ... there has seldom been such complete disagreement and breakdown of communication...",

For example, if you think a coin is biased then you won't want to assume that it lands heads with the same chance as tails. To deal with settings in which some outcomes have a higher chance than others, a more general theory is needed. In the 1930's, the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov (1903-1987) formulated some ground rules, known as axioms, that covered a rich array of settings and became the foundation of modern probability theory....",
